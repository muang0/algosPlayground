public class Palindrome {
    //  Problem: Implement a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome
    //  Solution: Extract the linked list into an array, compare the first half characters to the last half
    //  Time Complexity: O(n) since we are only looping through the list twice
    //  Space Complexity: O(n) since we are storing the input linkedList and it's corresponding array representation
    //  If we know the length of the linkedList, we can calculate this in one iteration
