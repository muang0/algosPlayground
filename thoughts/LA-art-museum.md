### Introduction
I visited the LA museum of art recently, and found the [metropolis](https://www.lacma.org/art/exhibition/metropolis-ii) exhibit particularly interesting. I found a relaxing spot on a balcony overlooking the exhibit, and let my mind wander and my fingers take flight. Below are my unfiltered notes, as well as a self-commentary on my thoughts.

### Unfiltered Notes
#### reverse engineer

	steps artist took:
	support beam through building- evidence of supports first then builing
	function of building size, support required

#### city aspects

	transportation
	collective group migration/activity

#### artists motivation/intended communicated meaning

	function of expected users interpretation

#### evolve

	focus on asthetic over transportation functionality
	migrate towards more visible pod rails
	Do we even need supports? migrate to stronger road material minimizes mount points required (only entrance/exits?)
	optimize traffic patterns

	cube city, standardize boundaries (moving city)
	minimize trains based on shared routing
	city day cycles (come to life, traffic die down, timings)
	lighting in city as a function of daytime, model people's collective group activity

	meta (required human operator/interaction simulating higher power)

	weather, natural disasters

#### random thoughts

	evolution of carrit/stick is intentionally setting up interactions/teams that will naturally function based on peoples assumed personas
	meta of tortured artist
	feedback on exhibit
		based on where people are standing in the exhibit hall
		multiple distinct hidden meanings *always easter eggs

#### easter eggs

	greenhouse in reflection path of skyscraper
	museum employee counting cars?
	structurally, buildings on platforms
